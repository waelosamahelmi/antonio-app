## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Print Dialog Will Appear
- This is **normal** for Android's print framework
- You'll need to **manually select** the printer
- This happens because we're using the native Print Manager
- For production, we can configure default printer

### If Print Dialog Doesn't Appear
- Check Android Settings → Printing
- Enable "Default Print Service"
- Make sure print services are enabled

### If Nothing Happens
1. **Open Chrome DevTools** (chrome://inspect)
2. **Watch console** for errors
3. **Check Android logs**: `adb logcat | findstr "Z92Printer"`
4. **Share the logs** with me

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Test Print Failed"
- **Check console** for exact error
- **Try logcat**: `adb logcat | findstr "Z92Printer"`
- **Verify** Z92PrinterPlugin is registered

### Print Dialog Opens But Can't Find Printer
- Check **Android Settings → Printing**
- Look for **available print services**
- Z92 may need specific print service installed

### No Dialog Appears
- **WebView may be blocked**
- Check **app permissions**
- Try running in Chrome DevTools to see errors

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

1. ✅ Connection succeeds instantly (no availability check)
2. ✅ Shows "Z92 printer marked as connected"
3. ✅ Test Print button shows Android print dialog
4. ✅ Can select printer from dialog
5. ✅ Receipt actually prints

## 📊 Next Steps After Testing

Once you can print successfully:

1. **Report what happens** when you click Test Print
2. **Share screenshot** of print dialog if it appears
3. **Share photo** of printed receipt if it works
4. **Share errors** if it fails

Then we can:
- Configure default printer to skip dialog
- Add auto-print for orders
- Customize receipt format
- Fine-tune print settings

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Your new APK is ready with **BYPASS MODE** enabled. No more availability checks - it will connect instantly and let you try printing right away!
